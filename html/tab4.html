<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    The lineal regression dots are increasing in a constant line over the
    months, it means that the dots are placed in a way it adjust to the behavior
    of KWH vs months graphic, as well it can see that in the months in
    consumption of KWH gets higher
  </p>

  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    The linear regression is unreliable because the points (red and gray) are
    very scattered and there is no definite behavior of the points
  </p>

  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>$$ 12.00 \cdot 6+ 226.80 $$ $$ $$ $$ y=298.8</p>

  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
  <p>
    The energy of the house is a little high because the people who live there
    often work from home and this increases the consumption, it could be reduced
    if when they are not using electronic devices they disconnected them and use
    them in a more conscientious way.
  </p>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    The trend is decreasing because as we can see in the graphic, 2 people spend
    more energy KWH than 4, this may be because it is difficult that all people
    are in the house at the same time so that the energy consumption is reduced.
  </p>

  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    The linear regression is decreasing and the points are very scattered with
    respect to the line, which means that the mathematical equation is not
    reliable.
  </p>

  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>$$ -14.43 \cdot 200+ 149.00 $$ $$ $$ $$ y= -2737</p>

  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <p>
    From this linear regression it can be concluded that it is necessary to
    regulate energy consumption on an individual way, because as shown, if only
    two people consume more energy than four, it means that they are making
    excessive use of energy, increasing the costs.
  </p>
</ul>
