<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis2Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    We observe that the tendency in lineal regression is decreasing in a
    constant line during the months, so the consume of kwhs is less, in general
    the facts show the consumption has been reduced
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    In the graphic we can analyze that red and grey dots are according to the
    data inserted, because it’s seen a big lower of kwh consumed during the
    months
  </p>

  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>$$-4.20\cdot 6+101.20 $$ $$ y=76</p>

  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
  <p>
    The energy that is spent in the house according to the relation of kWh, is
    because the electronic devices only are connected when needed, every member
    of the household is really conscious of the energy that is used, still,
    since the residents work and study, aren’t in house the whole day. My
    purpose to keep reducing energy waste in our house we will try to use solar
    light, we are still going to use in a responsable way the electrónica and
    supersede old light bulbs.
  </p>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis2Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis2Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    In this second graphic we can analyze that in comparison with the last
    tendency in lineal regression, is getting a higher quantity of kwh in
    relation with the residents in house, this happens when there’s an
    noticeable peak of kwhs spent in houses with 2,3 and 4 people
  </p>

  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    Based on the dots, i perceive a high difference between consume of kwh, the
    one that has a flagrant rise, even is higher tan houses with 6 residents,
    now talking about other dots, we consider that according to kwhs, we see
    that 2 residents in comparison with 4 residents, 4 has a lower consume even
    tho they are doble of the people, lastly 5 and 6 are appropriate to the
    activity or people
  </p>
  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>15.31\cdot 200+86.91 $$ $$ y=3148.91</p>

  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <p>
    In this part, is used to study residents vs kwhs quantity, we have to take
    in mind that exist different household variations, number of residents,
    place where it’s located, etc. The energy that is consumed vs number of
    people living in the house has a relation with the wasted kwhs, because when
    there’s more people usually there’s more consume, but still in this graphic
    is observed that the peak of excessive consume is in homes with 3 people
