<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis1Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    The inclination is increasing in a constanty line, it shows in each month
    which consume increases
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    We can say that red dots work with facts that are inserted, while grey dots
    are guided by red ones
  </p>

  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>$$ 17.80 \cdot 6 + 144.60 $$ y=251.4</p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
  <p>The energy that consumes in the house can be shown a bit high,</p>
</ul>

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    In the graphic we can see thet is increasing in a constant line, since in
    this case when there are more residents, we have more consumption of kWh,
    while in houses with 2 or 3 residents we see a lower consume
  </p>
  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    in this case we can evidence that if red dots get high, grey dots do as
    well, but the places where we can see a bigger difference is households with
    5 to 6 residents
  </p>

  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>$$ 67.79 \cdot 200 + -46.70 $$ y= 13511.3 o 153.3</p>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <p>
    In the graphic is shown that the avarage of residents per house is 2 and 3,
    and the consumption is almost the same, diferencent of 6 residents that
    contenin a really high fact in comparison with 4 and 5 residents
  </p>
</ul>
