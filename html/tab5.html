<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis4Plot1"></div>
<p id="analysis4Eqn1" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    The regresión in this graphic increases, but it’s not because the kWhs does,
    In my house case it presents an oscillation, now, it’s because the dots
    adjust according to the behavior of kWhs vs month graphic
  </p>

  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    The dots in red are working according to the information inserted, on the
    other hand, grey dots work according to red dots
  </p>

  <li>
    Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX
    syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>y=1.80x•6+102.00 y=112.8</p>

  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
  </li>
  <p>
    For remaining or reducing consumption we need to have a frequent use of
    natural lighting, but now basing in the graphic, we can analyze months where
    we had less consumption and try to imitate the activities that consumed
    during that month
  </p>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis4Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis4Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
  <p>
    In this graphic the lineal regression increases, in there we evidence that
    when there’s more residents, the consumption gets higher with it, so
    basically the dots in grey adjust according to the behavior
  </p>

  <li>The relation among the dots regarding the colors.</li>
  <p>
    It’s really noticeable that kWhs increases if there are more residents, in
    houses with 2 or 3 residents the spent energy is less in comparison with
    houses that have 6 or 7 residents
  </p>

  <li>
    Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$
    people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
  </li>
  <p>y=55.21x•200+(-25.54) y=11016.46</p>

  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation
    between these two variables.
  </li>
  <p>
    The relation is given because the lineal relation is used to value of
    unknown data by using another related and known data value, so basically,
    lineal regression dots depend on true consume (kWhs vs residents) so it they
    place according to it.
  </p>
</ul>
